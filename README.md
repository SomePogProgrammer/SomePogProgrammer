### Self-Taught | Full-Stack Web Developer

I Have 5+ Total Years of Programming Experience, 
I currently am a Full-Stack Web-Developer using the Full-Stack JS framework, Next.JS,
before I used to do Game Development, Game Desgin & Game UX/UI, and my first ever programming language was: **Lua**, which in my honest and totally unbiased opinion is far better than Python in many ways.


Work In Progress,

# Frameworks & Programming Languages

Most notably: **NextJS & ReactJS**

TypeScript & D.T.S & TSX, JavaScript & JSX, NextJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, CSS & SCSS, JSON, and ofcourse the humble HTML.

*Orignally I mastered Lua, with the LuaU framework, when I did game development. I then went on to learn Web Development and fell in love with it.*
*I still have a soft spot for Lua/LuaU, as it's an amazing, fast, and easliy written language. I recommend it to all beginners.*

# I Teach Programming!

**Another one of my passions is teaching Programming**

Most notably: I started a Web Development club at my old school. (Where I taught JS, CSS, and HTML)

But I also teach programming to college students, kids, adults, anyone who's interested.

I'm really good at explaining the process of programming. I've taught over a short period, a multitude of college graduates, and college students (even assisted them on their homework, assignments, and projects.) 

I love to help out others (especially on voice call), on online forums, and platforms.


# My Vision:


Ultimately I want to start up my own Programming school (hopefully funded by Microsoft, and big tech investors. *Microsoft plz contact me ü•∫*), and I hope to do this after I work a few years in the field. 

I plan to go to college to eventually obtain my PhD in Computer Programming/Computer Science, for no other reason but it gives me creditibility. üòÜ (Since I'm more than qualified to teach others, but obtaining a PhD will help when it comes to aquiring investors, and the hiring process, and along the way I can easily network whilst I'm attending school.)
